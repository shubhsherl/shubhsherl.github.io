### Hi, I'm **Shubham**, the guy behind and front of this site!  

I'm a sophomore at IIT Kanpur, who believe in technology and playing around with stuffs. I hail from Allahabad(U.P.), India. After years of slogging and hardwork, I finally managed to gain admission to the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur as an Undergratuate in Mathematics ~~and Scientific Computing~~. 

I am passionate about computer science, building things and celebrating the joy of programming.
I tend to waste my time reading books, watching movies, TV-series, playing games, hanging out with friends, sleeping and prcrstintng (...).

### Why did you decide to create a site?

I create the site based on the principle of: **to share my knowledge** and **to share my hobbies**.

I felt that I needed to expose all of my **raw accumulative knowledge** in something or somewhere. Making some search on the internet I discover that, to retain **75%** learners need to put into practice what they learned and incredible **90%** learners approximately retain when they teach someone else/use immediately.  

In general, to left my footprint on this virtual world, and to bore you all.

### How can I contact you?
Why you want to contact me, I am  no use to you!!
Still you want to chat, give and receive advice/tips and so forth?

### What inspires me.
[Matthew 25:14 ~ 30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:14-30)  
We are unhappy because we neglect and buried our talents

#### One more thing
You noticed that I'm not an **"English native"** not even an **"Expert"**, but I'm writing in English because I want to get better and reach to the fluency. I'll appreciate if you help me spend your precious time send me your suggestion and correction about my sentences. ;)
