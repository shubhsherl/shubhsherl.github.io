For a long time, 1 Kilobyte=1024 bytes, 1 Megabyte = 1024 kilobytes, 1 Gigabyte = 1024 megabytes, and so on. The reason being the fact that it easier to do binary math when working with powers of two.

However, the prefix "kilo" means 1000, and not 1024, and the same reasoning applies for "mega", "giga", etc. So some people used 1 Kilobyte as being 1000 bytes. It all became very confusing.

In order to solve that, the  [International Electrotechnical Commission](https://www.iec.ch/) proposed in 1998 the nomenclature of 1 Kibibyte (KiB) = 1024 bytes, 1 Mebibyte (MiB) = 1024 KiB, 1 Gibibyte = 1024 MiB, ... you get the idea.

So, today all major standards consider that 1 Kibibyte (KiB) = 1024 bytes, and 1 Kilobyte (KB) = 1000 bytes. This is what storage manufacturers currently use.

However, a lot of old software still uses the old nomenclature. And some new software written by people who don't know or don't care about this distinction.
